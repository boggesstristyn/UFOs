# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a table with JavaScript that holds data from a muriad of UFO sightings from all over the country and be able to filter based on different criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

## Results

The final visualization is both visually pleasing and user friendly. The page provides many UFO sigtings that can easily be filtered.

Upon opening the page, prior to any filters being added, you'll find:

Filters can be set by simply inputing any of the five criteria. Here, the date was filtered to 1/4/2010 and city to San Pablo:

To clear the filters you can click the 'UFO Sightings' banner in the top left.

## Summary

While the site is fairly easy to navigate, there is a minor drawback. In order to properly search city results, the user must specifically enter the name in all lower-case spelling. No other spelling, casing, additional spaces or characters will produce a result.
